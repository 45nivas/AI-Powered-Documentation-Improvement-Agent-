# MoEngage AI-Powered Documentation Improvement Agent

## 🚀 Overview

This project was built as part of a technical coding assignment. It aims to improve the clarity, usability, and accessibility of documentation articles from the MoEngage Help Center using AI.

The project features two intelligent agents:

---

## 🛠️ Features

### 🔹 Agent 1: Documentation Analyzer

* Accepts a MoEngage article URL as input.
* Uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape article content.
* Applies readability metrics (Flesch-Kincaid Grade, Flesch Reading Ease, Gunning Fog).
* Leverages an LLM (via Ollama, or optionally OpenAI/Gemini) to generate a structured report.
* Outputs a Markdown report with assessments and actionable suggestions across:

  * Readability for marketers
  * Structure and flow
  * Completeness of content and examples
  * Style guidelines (based on Microsoft Style Guide)

### 🔹 Agent 2 (Bonus): Documentation Revision Agent

* Takes the original article and suggestions from Agent 1.
* Uses an LLM to revise the documentation automatically.
* Outputs a revised Markdown file with improved structure, clarity, and tone.

## 📊 About Readability Scores

This project uses three standard readability metrics to check how easy your documentation is to read:

- **Flesch Reading Ease:**  
  Scores range from 0 (very hard) to 100 (very easy).  
  Higher scores mean the text is easier to read.  
  Example: A score of 33.60 means the text is quite difficult, likely for college-level readers.

- **Flesch-Kincaid Grade:**  
  Shows the U.S. school grade level needed to understand the text.  
  Example: A score of 12.49 means it’s best for someone at the end of high school or above.

- **Gunning Fog Index:**  
  Estimates the years of education needed to understand the text.  
  Example: A score of 14.80 means it’s suitable for college-level readers.

**Tip:**  
For marketer-friendly docs, aim for lower grade levels and higher reading ease.  
Shorter sentences and simpler words make your documentation more accessible.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* Chrome + ChromeDriver  
  > 💡 Download ChromeDriver matching your Chrome version from: [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
* Ollama (for running local LLMs like mistral)

### Installation

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Selenium Setup

* ChromeDriver must be installed and added to PATH.
* Selenium is run in non-headless mode to bypass MoEngage’s "I'm not a robot" check.

### Ollama Setup (Optional: for local LLM)

```sh
# Download and install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama run mistral
```

## ▶️ How to Run Each Agent

### 🔹 Run Agent 1 (Analyze an article)

```sh
python main.py
```

* Input the article URL when prompted.
* Input the filename to save the output.
* Output saved to: `outputs/example_output_1.md`

### 🔹 Automatic Extraction of Actionable Suggestions

When you run `main.py`, the script will:

* Analyze the article and save the full report in the `outputs` folder.
* **Automatically extract actionable suggestions from the report and save them as `outputs/actionable_suggestions.txt`.**
* This file is then used directly by Agent 2 (`revise.py`) for the revision step.

### 🔹 Save the Original Article Content (Required for Task 2)

Before running Agent 2, you must save the original article content:

```sh
python save_original.py
```
- This script will fetch the article and save it as `original_article.txt` in your project folder.

### 🔹 Run Agent 2 (Revise the article)

```sh
python revise.py
```

* This script will load the original article and suggestions.
* Output saved to: `outputs/revised_article.md`

## 📝 Example Output (Snippet)

```
## 1. Readability for Marketers
Assessment: The language is simple, but it lacks marketer-specific context.
Suggestions:
- Add use cases relevant to campaign managers.
- Define terms like "dashboard" or "event analytics".
```

See the full output in `outputs/example_output_1.md`.

## 🧠 Assumptions Made

* Marketers are the primary audience.
* Most MoEngage articles require basic readability and structural improvements.
* LLMs (like Mistral) can follow structured prompts to assess tone, clarity, and examples.
* Web scraping is allowed for this assignment since no API was provided.

---

## 💡 Design Choices & Approach

* Used Selenium to handle MoEngage's bot detection.
* Decoupled scraping, analysis, and revision into separate files.
* Used markdown format for human-friendly output.
* Used textstat for readability scoring.
* Structured prompts for LLMs for actionable, context-aware feedback.

## 🏔️ Challenges Faced & Solutions

| Challenge                    | Solution                               |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| MoEngage’s bot protection    | Used Selenium in non-headless mode     |
| Inconsistent LLM responses   | Ran multiple LLM passes, picked best   |
| Avoiding generic suggestions | Injected full article text into prompt |
| Formatting output clearly    | Structured prompts + markdown output   |

---

## 🧠 LLM Backend Switching

The analyzer supports switching between local (Ollama) and cloud (Gemini) LLMs.  
Set the `LLM_BACKEND` environment variable to `ollama` (default) or `gemini` as needed.  
Ollama requires no API key; Gemini requires a Google API key.
