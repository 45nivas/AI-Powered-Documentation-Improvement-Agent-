 # User Guide: Analyzing Notification Frequency with MoEngage Analytics

Growth teams need to strike the right balance when it comes to communicating with their customers through push notifications and emails. Too few or too many can impact user engagement, potentially leading to app uninstallations. This guide will show you how to analyze notification frequency using MoEngage Analytics.

## Importance of Notification Frequency Analysis

Push notifications play a crucial role in marketing, and ensuring users receive the right number is essential for boosting app engagement. Too many notifications can drive users away, while too few may not keep them engaged enough. Regularly analyzing notification frequency helps prevent this issue.

## Analyzing Notification Frequency with MoEngage Analytics

### Overall Distribution

1. Navigate to **Analytics > Behavior**.
2. Select `Notification Received Android` as an event.
3. Choose `Total events per user` as the Analysis type and `Distribution` as the Aggregation type in the **Behavior Options** section, then click on the `Apply` button.

This analysis plots percentile users against the number of times they have received a notification. For example, the bottom 10% of users receive one notification, the 50th percentile receives seven notifications, and the 90th percentile receives fifteen notifications in the last 7 days.

### Custom Distribution

You can customize the distribution bucket based on your desired analysis to see how many users are receiving too many notifications or a specific number of notifications. You can view the user count for the selected bucket at the hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly level, or you can view the user count for the selected bucket over the entire time duration.

## Using Notification Frequency Analysis to Optimize Your Marketing Strategy

The ideal number of notifications varies depending on the industry and app content/services. As a marketer, you'll want to analyze:

- Users who receive too many notifications and whether they are uninstalling.
- Users who receive too few notifications and whether they are engaging enough.
- Users who receive an average number of notifications and whether they are converting.

By analyzing the frequency, you can take the necessary steps to control the number of notifications and optimize for these metrics and overall user experience. Additionally, you can answer other questions like:

- How many times do users open the app?
- How many users are repeat buyers?
- How many users open the app or buy too infrequently?
- What was the highest number of purchases per user last month?

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily analyze notification frequency using MoEngage Analytics and optimize your marketing strategy for better engagement, retention, and conversions.
