 # User Guide: Analyzing Notification Frequency with MoEngage Analytics

Growth teams need to strike a balance between keeping their customers engaged and not overwhelming them with too many push notifications or emails. This guide will show you how to use MoEngage Analytics to analyze the number of notifications your users are receiving, helping you maintain that balance.

## Why Analyze Notification Frequency?

Push notifications play a crucial role in marketing, but it's essential to ensure users receive the right number. Too few can lead to decreased engagement, while too many may cause users to uninstall your app. Regularly analyzing notification frequency helps prevent this.

## How to Analyze Notification Frequency with MoEngage Analytics

### Overall Distribution

1. Navigate to **Analytics > Behavior**.
2. Select `Notification Received (Android)` as an event.
3. Choose `Total events per user` as the Analysis type and `Distribution` as the Aggregation type in the **Behavior Options** section, then click on **Apply**.

This analysis plots percentile users against the number of times they have received a notification. For example, the bottom 10% of users receive one notification, the 50th percentile receives seven notifications, and the 90th percentile receives fifteen notifications in the last 7 days.

### Custom Distribution

You can modify the distribution bucket based on your desired analysis to see how many users are receiving too many notifications or a specific number of notifications. You can view the user count for the selected bucket at the hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly level or for the entire time duration.

## Interpreting Your Analysis Results

The ideal number of notifications to send varies by industry and app content/services. As a marketer, you should analyze:

- Users receiving more notifications and whether they are uninstalling.
- Users receiving fewer notifications and whether they are engaging enough.
- Users receiving an average number of notifications and whether they are converting.

With this analysis, you can take the necessary steps to control the number of notifications and optimize for these metrics and overall user experience.

You can also use MoEngage Analytics to answer other questions like:

- How many times do users open the app?
- How many users are repeat buyers?
- How many users open the app or buy too infrequently?
- What was the highest number of purchases per user for last month?
